This is a public repository from my public website. I made this public so I can learn from you! I know my code is anything but perfect so I hope I can count on you guys to get it as close to perfect as possible!

Let's begin
-----------

- change a config.yml file in the config directory
- add a dataabase.yml file in the config directory

Config.yml
----------

Should look like this:

    fousa:
        password: <your password>


Database.yml
------------

Should look something like this:

    development:
      adapter: <your-database-adapter>
      database: <your-database>
      username: <your-username>
      charset: utf8

Can I count on you?
-------------------

Can you help me to get my website's code better!
