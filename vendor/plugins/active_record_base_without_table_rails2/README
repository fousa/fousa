I use the active_record_base_without_table from http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/activerecord_base_without_table to validate the fields of my contact form. The reason why is because all the validation rules are at the same place and I don't like to do manual checks in the controllers. So that is why I use a model that has data, but doesn't gets saved to a database. More info on how to use this plug-in can be found on the above link.

But with the new version of rails (any version newer then 2.0) there is a small problem. The read_methods is used in the reset_column_information method instead of the newer generated_methods. This results in a compilation error, so that is why I searched and found this patch http://gitorious.org/projects/activerecord-basewithouttable-for-rails-2. 

Just install the plugin from the repository above with the following command. I copied the plugin from here (git://gitorious.org/activerecord-basewithouttable-for-rails-2/mainline.git) but I had trouble installing it and I copied the plugin to my personal repository.

== Instructions

* For edge Rails r7315 or above use http://svn.viney.net.nz/things/branches/active_record_base_without_table

Get the power of ActiveRecord models, including validation, without having a table in the database.

  class Contact < ActiveRecord::BaseWithoutTable
    column :name, :string
    column :email_address, :string
    column :message, :text
    
    validates_presence_of :name, :email_address, :string
  end
  
This model can be used just like a regular model based on a table, except it will never be saved to the database.

There is a good blog post available on the plugin:
